The General
===========

This is an incomplete General Game Playing program. It takes games written in Game Description Language, which describe states and state transitions for deterministic games of perfect information.

It's written in C, with yacc/lex for parsing the GDL. It works by generating a C program to play the given game.

It's pretty incomplete (it can't actually play any games), and should be rewritten in a better language...
